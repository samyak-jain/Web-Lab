7 Most Useful Difference Between Data mining vs Web mining

Difference Between Data mining and Web mining
Data mining It is a concept of identifying a significant pattern from the data that gives a better outcome
Identifying patterns from where From the data that are generated from the systems
Web mining Process of performing Data mining in the web is called Web mining Extracting the web documents and discovering the patterns from it
Example Techniques applied for  Weather forecast based on identifying the patterns from the history data
Lets us understand the major Difference Between Data mining and Web mining in a detail in this post
Analogy
Gold is produced by the process called gold mining It is extracted and refined from the ore The final outcome of gold mining is the precious metal Likewise
to get key information data that is worth from a raw source  is applied Here the pattern discovered from the raw data source is considered precious for the  in order to proceed with the  that influences the business value
Data mining
In plain terms data mining is a concept of mining knowledge from different sets of data The knowledge extracted is further used to provide forecasts or recommendations The data to be mined are either available in the  or other external systems Data could be available on different tables with its different behavioral or attributes In order to identify the pattern the correlation between multiple sets of data has to be identified
Steps in Data mining
As data mining is an abstract here is the list of steps involved

Data preparation
Pattern discovery
Build models to forecastrecommendto mention few cases
Summarizing the model value

Web mining
Web mining is an abstract as there are three different types of techniques of mining

Web content mining
Web structure mining
Web usage mining

Web mining classes of information gathering
Web content mining
Data from the web pages are extracted in order to discover different patterns that give a significant insight There are many techniques to extract the data like web scraping for instance – scrapy and Octoparse are the wellknown tools that performs the web content mining process
One of the best example – In order to conduct an event or any program first the organization analyze about the locations which location is best suited to conduct the program so that there will be full attendance In order to perform these analyses one has to gather locationspecific information about the city state and how far the event from the invitee is’s located Any locationspecific data can be extracted from the web That’s where the web content mining comes into the picture
Web Structure mining
Data from hyperlinks that lead to different pages are gathered and prepared in order to discover a pattern In order to view a person’s public profile from a blog or any other webpage there are chances that they would embed their  links So the data is not only extracted from a single source but also from the nested pages through the hyperlinks associated with each page There are various algorithms to perform this Example PageRank algorithm
Web usage mining
When a web application is hosted there are plenty of web server logs that gets generated about the application’s user web activity These logs are considered as a raw data in return meaningful data are extracted and patterns are identified
For instance for any ecommerce business when they want to increase the scope of business or add an enhancement for better customer experience user’s web activity through the application logs are monitored and data mining is applied to it
Web mining and data mining are more or less similar techniques but web mining is all about analysis on the web Data mining is not limited to the web It’s a traditional process that takes place for any data analytics
Talking about the data from the web there are varieties of data that can be observed It could be   data are pulled through API if it is released for public Semistructured data – any web activity related or even server logs pull Or even unstructured data like images etc if any analysis are performed on images
Head To Head Comparision Between Data mining vs Web mining Infographics
Below is the Top 7 Comparisons Between Data mining vs Web mining
Key Differences Between Data mining vs Web mining
The following is the Difference Between Data mining and Web mining are as follows
Web mining and data mining are both nearly similar when comes to identifying the patterns But where and what is the difference in web mining from the  What kind of data and data is extracted from where These are the two ultimate aspects that bring the difference between Data mining and Web mining
Web mining comes under data mining but this is limited to web related data and identifying the patterns Data mining is a vast concept that involves multiple steps starting from preparing the data till validating the end results that lead to the decisionmaking process for an organization

Conclusion – Data mining vs Web mining
Any mining techniques with the data are to discover the knowledge and how well it could be used to accomplish a better outcome Organizations that are keen on enhancing their businesses and make a high profit they need many decisions to make based on the data that are largely available in their systems generated in humongous volume Not all data is considered to give knowledge and insights Which why and what are the main questions data scientistsdata analysts have to think about when they prepare to identify the patterns In a very layman’s term data mining is like a process of churning the milk to make butter
