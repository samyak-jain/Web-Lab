We help people own their digital presence.
It's not just wishful thinking. It's our noble cause — an idea that drives everything we do.
When you put your dreams online—your words, your photos, your creations—you shouldn't have to worry about your service provider mining that data for marketing purposes. Those are your dreams — not ours! DreamHost's open platform gives you the power to share your data and the freedom to control how it's used.


Our vision and mission
We believe in a world where people have the freedom to choose how their digital content is shared, and we foster their success by providing an open web platform of choice.


Open source is in our DNA
We support WordPress, a powerful open source content management system for the web. We help to make WordPress better with code, community contributions, and expert-level support.


Real support 24/7/365
Our award-winning in-house support staff is available to you all day, every day, via live chat, email, and social media.


Over 400k+ happy customers
Since the dorm room back in 1997, our customer count has grown to over 400,000, spanning throughout more than 100 countries. That's nuts, right?


1.5 million + websites
DreamHost proudly hosts over 1.5 million websites, WordPress blogs, and applications for designers, developers, small businesses, and more.


750k+ WordPress installations
Weâve been hosting WordPress websites and blogs since the beginning. Our friendly in-house WordPress experts are here to help you do amazing things!






Our Core Values.
We're passionate people. We eat, sleep and live this stuff.
