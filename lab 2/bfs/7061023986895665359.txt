Frequently Asked Questions About Monthly Web Hosting




							What is Monthly Web Hosting?
						

Monthly Web Hosting is web hosting that is paid on a monthly basis with no long term commitment. We consider it flexible hosting as the customer can cancel whenever theyâd like. The downside of monthly hosting is that there are cheaper alternatives when you pre-pay for longer annual or 3-year terms.




							Do Monthly Hosting Plans remove features or functionality?
						

Absolutely not. Our monthly Shared, VPS, and Managed WordPress hosting plans include all the same functionality as our annual plans.




							Where can I learn more about the features of each product?

							What is the difference between Shared Hosting and VPS Hosting?
						

The difference between Shared and VPS hosting boils down to three keys - resources, performance, and price. 


Resources — Shared hosting shares resources with other websites. VPS hosting allocates resources only to your website.

Performance — The reason most people choose a virtual server (VPS) over a shared server is the expectation of higher performance. Compared to a shared server, VPS hosting is more agile and responsive. The increased speed is due primarily to its dedicated server resources in addition to memory (RAM).

Pricing — Shared hosting is almost always less expensive than other options as more individuals help spread the server costs across hundreds of websites. Virtual Servers on the other hand host fewer websites but are more expensive. Regardless of your choice, DreamHost doesnât over-sell its servers (unlike many of our competitors where thatâs commonplace).
