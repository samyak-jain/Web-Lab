Frequently Asked Questions About our Virtual Server Hosting




								What is VPS hosting and virtual servers?
							

VPS is short for
									virtual private server and is also known as a
									virtual server. VPS Hosting is a hosting solution for websites and applications, where server resources are
									isolated for individual users. VPS users experience more consistent performance, which translates to more responsive
									and faster websites.




								What is the difference between a virtual server and a dedicated server?
							

A virtual server and a dedicated server differ by the number of users that possess resources on a physical server.
									With a virtual private server, some of the resources are isolated for individual users, but there are multiple users
									on the same physical server. With a dedicated server, a single user has access to all of the resources of a physical
									server.

								Does DreamHost offer VPS hosting with
								root access?
							

Our Managed Virtual Servers do not offer root access. However, many of our customers who require full control use
									our cloud servers, which have root level access.

								What is the difference between shared hosting and VPS hosting?
							

The difference between shared and VPS hosting comes down to three things: resources, price, and performance.


Resources — Plain and simple, shared hosting is sharing a server with other websites, where VPS hosting
										provides server resources dedicated to you.

Pricing — Shared hosting is generally cheaper because resources are shared with more users. Virtual Servers
										on the other hand, generally have fewer websites, but are more expensive.
										
Performance — The reason most people choose VPS over shared is because of performance. Their website
											or application has heavy resource demands, or they have a higher expectation of performance. VPS powered websites,
											when managed correctly (like we do here at DreamHost), are much faster and more responsive.

								Does DreamHost offer Windows VPS hosting?
							

No, we do not have Windows VPS hosting options. Our VPS solution uses Linux.










Unmanaged VPS Powered by the Cloud
Our unmanaged VPS is powered by DreamCompute, our cloud computing platform. DreamCompute harnesses the power of the Open
					Web and the OpenStack cloud stack to give you full control of virtual machines with full root access. DreamCompute is
