FAQs About DreamHost Shared Web Servers




          What is Shared hosting?
        

Web hosting is simply a computer (server) that allows you to publish your website on the internet for the world to see. A hosting provider, also called a web host, rents server space to its customers. When users are on your website, all of your siteâs data travels from the web host to the your userâs browser. Make sense?
Shared Hosting is a particular type of web hosting service where websites share the same physical server with many other users, effectively reducing the cost of hosting. While shared hosting shares resources, like cpu, ram, bandwidth and disk space, your files are protected and isolated from others.




          What is the difference between Shared hosting and VPS hosting?
        

It all comes down to resources. In a Shared hosting environment resources are shared amongst all websites on that web server. With VPS hosting, resources are shared across the web server, but specific resources are yours and no one else can use them.

            How many SSL certificates are included?
          

We include an SSL certificate with all of your domains hosted by DreamHost. DreamHost has partnered with Let's Encrypt and provides 1-Click SSL installations in our custom control panel.

              How many email accounts can I have?
            

DreamHost includes email hosting for all websites hosted with us, with the exception of "Shared Starter" and "Remixer Standard", which does not include email hosting. On all other plans, the number of email accounts you can create is unlimited.

          What is the difference between Shared hosting and Dedicated hosting?
        

Whoa. That is a big jump. There are some large differences in the two. Price for one, but to keep it simple, a Dedicated server is all yours. With Shared hosting it is not.
Learn More




          Does Shared Hosting come with cPanel or some other control panel?
        

Our Shared hosting plans do not include cPanel. Rather we have a built a custom control panel that is easy to use and intuitive. From our control panel, you have all of the control of cPanel, only better.  
Learn More




          Do you offer hosting on Windows operating systems, including ASP.NET or Windows Server?
        

DreamHost Shared Hosting servers are completely Linux. Microsoft technologies are not supported, and we currently do not have a Windows hosting offering.
