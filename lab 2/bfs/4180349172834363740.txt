Frequently Asked Questions About Domain Names

What is a domain name?
A domain name is the web address or URL where visitors find your site. A custom domain gives your site a professional look, strengthens your brand, and helps visitors find you on the web.


What can I do with a domain name?
With a domain name, you can direct customers, prospective customers, and friends to anywhere you want on the web like a website, social page, blog, or ecommerce store. A domain name is often the most important part of your brand.


What domain should I buy?
We offer hundreds of domains from the classic .COM and .NET to country specific domains like .US and .CA to newer domain extensions like .CLUB, .ME, .NINJA, and .SPACE. Itâs often a good idea to register more than one domain extension to protect your brand or idea.


I have a domain name at a different company. Can I transfer it to DreamHost?
Yes, DreamHost specializes in domain names. You can transfer your current domains to DreamHost and also take advantage of our WHOIS Domain Privacy thatâs included free.


I want to use DreamHost for domains and web hosting, but my current domain name is registered at my old hosting company. Can I use it with DreamHost?
Yes. You can either connect the existing domain or transfer it. Connecting the domain keeps it at your current host but lets you use it with DreamHost. Transferring the domain lets you manage both your domain and hosting at DreamHost.We recommend transferring your domain to DreamHost, so you can manage your entire website in one location.


What is WHOIS Domain Privacy and why is it important?
Also called private registration, WHOIS Domain Privacy protects your personal information (phone number, email, and physical address) from being shown in the publicly available WHOIS database.As background, ICANN, the governing body for domain names, mandates that all domain registrars publish the personal contact information of domain registrants in the public WHOIS database. Email and phone scammers scrape and collect this information for spam, scams, and identity theft.Domain Privacy prevents these spammers from collecting your personal info. DreamHostâs complementary (yes itâs free for the life of your domain) Domain Privacy service works by masksing your personal information in the WHOIS database with DreamHostâs corporate information, so youâre protected from unscrupulous marketers, spammers, robo-callers, junk mailers, and stalkers.


How much does DreamHost WHOIS Domain Privacy cost?
Itâs free.We believe you should be able to control how much of your personal information is shared online. Thatâs why we include WHOIS Domain Privacy free for the life of your domain registration (not just the first year).Compare us to our competitors who charge $14/yr. and more for private registration, (even more than the price of the domain!) and see how much you can save by registering your domains at DreamHost.Many of our customers save hundreds of dollars each year in private registration costs by transferring existing domains from their current domain registrar or hosting company to DreamHost. Over time, these fees really add up, and consolidating all your domains at DreamHost can help save you money long term.


How many domains can I host at DreamHost?
With our Shared and VPS hosting plans, you can host an unlimited number of domains in one account. Create email addresses at each domain, set up email forwarders to send email to your primary email account, and forward domains to existing websites or social pages. DreamHostâs control panel is straightforward and gives you total control over all domain records.


For Personal Use - How can I promote myself with a domain name?
Registering a domain name lets you create a personal presence on the web. With your own web address, you can control your online identity by linking to any other site with more information about you. For example, you can register a domain name and forward it to a website, blog, or social profile page like your Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter pages. A domain name can protect your personal brand and help your career.


Can I use my domain name for email while still pointing it to another site like LinkedIn?
Yes, you can set up email at your custom domain name while still pointing it to another website like LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter. Sending email from your own custom domain name not only makes you look professional but also gives you legitimacy by showing youâre web savvy.
