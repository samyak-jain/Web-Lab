Everything You Need For WordPress to Take Off





All WordPress Plans
DreamPress






Automatic WordPress Updates
We update your site to the latest WordPress and security updates - often within hours of release - to protect you from newly discovered vulnerabilities.



WordPress Preconfigured
We install WordPress along with a number of battle-tested themes and plugins with every site, letting you avoid menial setup grunt work.



FREE SSL Security
We include a 1-click Letâs Encrypt SSL certificate so the data passed between you and your siteâs visitors is always safely encrypted.





Fast SSD Storage
All your files are stored on high-performance solid-state drives, giving you up to 200% better performance than traditional hard drives, or âspinning rustâ as we like to say.



Domain Privacy
We're committed to your privacy. Unlike most providers, we still don't charge a fee to mask your personal information to safeguard you from creepers. $12/year value!



Unlimited Email @ Your Domain
Create as many addresses as you want with POP/IMAP/SMTP accounts. Plus support for autoresponders, webmail, filtering rules, and advanced spam protection.






Custom Control Panel
We've designed and built our control panel and dashboards entirely in-house, giving us plenty of flexibility to build the features and functionality that make managing WordPress easy.



Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Dual WordPress-optimized WAFs fight off malicious HTTP traffic, provide brute-force mitigation, and ensure your site and server remains safe and accessible. $250/year value.



Complete Domain Management
Manage as many domain registrations as you like with complete support for parked domains, subdomains, Custom DNS, and more. Become a true master of your domain with DreamHost.





SFTP Access
FTP is old, slow, insecure, and just plain gross. So weâve phased out FTP at DreamHost in favor of SFTP, the encrypted, modern take on an old file transfer classic.



SSH Access
Optionally available for power users, SSH allows you to manage your website via command line shell access. We disable it by default for security reasons, but if you are sure you know what youâre doing, we'll happily flip that switch for you.



WP-CLI
Interact with your site from the command line - or even programmatically - with WP-CLI. We sponsor WP-CLI and have been among the first to include advanced commands like wp-doctor and wp-profile.









Server-Level Caching
With Memcached, Varnish, OPcache, and more baked into the server environment itself, you never have to bother with complex caching plugins again.



Fast Provisioning
Thanks to our powerful and scalable cloud architecture, launching a DreamPress instance to power your next website project happens in under 5 minutes.



Instant Upgrades
If your site grows in size and popularity itâll need what Arnold Schwarzenegger calls - MORE POWAH! No machine guns required â upgrade to a more powerful plan with just a click.





Object Caching
We use Memcached as a persistent caching layer for your database, pre-fetching data and serving it up faster than the underlying database could ever do on its own. This, along with opcache to optimize PHP functions places a lower workload on the server and lets you handle more concurrent visitors.



Varnish Caching
Varnish sits between NGINX and Apache web servers, speeding up your site's performance and completely negating the need for any of WordPressâ many caching plugins. Server-level content caching is the future. True, we said that about mylar jumpsuits in the 90s, but we mean it this time.



Brotli Compression
The smaller your site, the faster it runs. Weâve baked in Googleâs Brotli compression software right into all our servers to help improve delivery times for sites of all sizes.





HTTPS By Default
All DreamPress sites are automatically configured with HTTPS, encrypting traffic between your site and its visitors (and even boosting your SEO) without any extra work. Secure certificates from âLetâs Encryptâ bring encryption to the masses.



NGINX with HTTP2 Enabled
The latest and greatest in open source web server technology, these two components bring the promise of the modern web thanks to significant performance improvements over their predecessors.
















Managed WordPress is Perfect for…



Bloggers



Small Business



eCommerce



Designers



Developers







Bloggers
Building an audience isn't easy. It takes commitment, passion, and drive. You don't have time to spend managing servers,
						tweaking PHP versions, or worrying about whether or not your site's been hacked. DreamPress' automatic updates and
						strong security defenses take the heavy-lifting server management part of WordPress off your hands so you can focus
						on creating great content that keeps your readers coming back for more. And the fact that it's blazing fast, so your
						readers don't have to wait for your pages to load, is just icing on the cake.







Small Business
You've got a website for a reason: getting customers. Whether it's showing people your menu or convincing them to fill
						out your contact form, performance is key - every study shows that the faster the site, the better visitors convert.
						DreamPress' high-performance architecture gives your visitors a first impression that matters. And not only is DreamPress
						built on our incredibly stable cloud technology, it's designed to accommodate seamless resource upgrades so your online
						presence remains open for business – no matter what.







eCommerce
Conversions, conversions, conversions. Running a successful eCommerce business comes down to making sales. Performance
						is key; Google and Amazon know that the faster the page, the more customers buy. Let us take care of that performance
						for you, on DreamPress' stable and blazing-fast cloud architecture. Our WooCommerce-optimized plans make sure that
						you can build any type of storefront you want, easily and quickly. And with the security of dual firewalls and an integrated
						malware scanner, you can rest easy knowing buyers can find you anytime, day or night.







Designers
Nothing disappoints a client more than a demo site that takes forever to load. Let DreamPress' speed work to your advantage
						by delivering a powerful – and fast – first impression. And when your design turns to implementation, don't
						worry about whether or not that plugin you need is "off-limits;" our do-what-you-want plugin policy means that you
						can use it. Plus, our dual web firewalls and malware scanner keep your sites safe and let you focus on what really
						matters: the user experience.







Developers
DreamPress by developers, for developers. We built our OpenStack cloud platform for our own use. Now
						you can take advantage of our cloud infrastructure. DreamPress handles all the caching, backups, and security for you,
						so you can focus on building the features and tools that your customers are asking for. Available staging sites mean
						that your workflow works for you, not the other way around. And DreamPress' blazing speed and unlimited plugin policy
						gives you the flexibility to build what you need to, how you need to.
