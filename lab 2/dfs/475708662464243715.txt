Frequently Asked Questions



						Does DreamHost Web Hosting Include a Domain Name?
					

Shared web hosting plans with annual or longer terms include a free domain name (.COM, .NET, .ORG, .CLUB, .INFO, .LIFE, .ONLINE, .STORE, .TECH) and free WHOIS Privacy protection (normally a paid service at most of our competitors).





						Does Web Hosting Include Email?
					

Email hosting is included for FREE with all of the hosting plans (this includes free Webmail service as well). Please note that itâs not possible to host email without a hosting plan, and that there is a 2GB limit on email.





						Does DreamHost Also Have a Website Builder?
					

Yes. DreamHost offers Remixer, our modern website builder that makes publishing a beautiful website simple. For more advanced sites, we recommend using our custom integrated WordPress, the world's most popular and advanced website builder. From simple sites to complex, WordPress creates modern, responsive websites designed to grow with your ambition.





						I Have a Domain Name at a Different Company. Can I transfer it to DreamHost?
					

Yes, DreamHost specializes not just in web hosting but also domains. You can transfer your current domain to DreamHost and also take advantage of our WHOIS Privacy that's included free. If you are interested in transferring a domain name, read our documentation.





						Can I âTest Driveâ Any of Your Products?
					

Our Shared Hosting plan comes with a 97-Day Money-Back Guarantee, and our DreamPress plans come with 30-Day Money-Back Guarantees. Sign up for either (or both), try it out, and if it's not everything youâd imagined: cancel within the guarantee timeframe (warning: youâll love our products, so cancelling probably wonât happen).
