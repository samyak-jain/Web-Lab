FAQs About DreamHost Dedicated Servers




							What is Dedicated Hosting?
						

Think of a dedicated web server as a storage unit for your website or web applications. It keeps documents, videos, images and other computer files online. Web hosting companies rent space to you. All youâve got to do is upload files or a website onto the server.




							Shared Hosting vs Dedicated Hosting
						

Shared: If youâre new to web hosting, a shared platform is great for learning the ropes. Itâs perfectly adequate for businesses and websites that have light to moderate web traffic and donât require complex, customized server configurations.
Dedicated: With this option, youâre the sole user on the server. Its capacity and resources are all yours. This gives you much more control over its configuration and overall operating environment. Thereâs also a wider variety of services and software to choose from.

							What can you do with a Dedicated Server?
						

Dedicated servers are fully-managed, business class servers. They are perfect for resource-heavy apps and giant websites. With a dedicated server, you have full control over how to configure your hosting environment making it perfect for major hosting needs.




							What are the reasons to choose a Dedicated Server?
						

A dedicated server is the ultimate in power, security, and control. With a dedicated server, you wonât have to share resources with anyone. Here are some of the top reasons that people choose a dedicated server over other hosting options:

Security is a top priority
You expect consistently high levels of traffic
Page load times need to be lightning fast
You need custom programming options
Youâre anticipating major growth

Learn More






							Do I need Dedicated Hosting?
						

If you have a site that needs reliable web hosting, you may want to think about dedicated hosting. Unlike shared web hosting, you have control over your own server. You'll experience enhanced security because you won't ever need to share the server with anyone else.
Learn More




							VPS vs Dedicated Hosting
						

VPS: A Virtual Private Server, still involves hosting several websites on the same server, but there's a hypervisor that ensures that one website doesn't start causing trouble for the other sites on the server. With VPS Hosting, you're allocated a certain amount of RAM, bandwidth and server space.
Dedicated: You're able to choose the equipment, including the amount and type of RAM, the size and type of hard drive and the processor, used in the server. Further, 100 percent of the server's resources are allocated to your site and they aren't shared with any others.

							Whatâs included with a Dedicated Server?
						

With a dedicated server, youâll have access to all the resources to handle even the highest traffic websites. With plenty of room to grow, you won't have to worry about RAM, disk space or bandwidth ever again.
Learn More




							What are the reasons to not use a Dedicated Server?
						

Plain and simple, a dedicated server is a much higher expense than say, shared hosting. If you arenât sure that you need all of the resources of a dedicated server, you may want to consider choosing a more cost effective option like VPS.
